Arduino-OSC2DMX
===============

Arduino OSC to DMX

Uses an ethernet shield to connect to a wifi-router/AP
receives OSC commands from an iPad (for example) running TouchOSC or Lemur
converts those commands to DMX and sends them out to fixtures. 

Early work in progress, conveting code from a similar project to work with the Arduino DMX shield I use, with a different DMX library.
